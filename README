INTRODUCTION:

This is a simple C++ code to solve Hanamaya's cast Laby automatically.
More info on this project can be found online at http://www.somebod.com.

REQUIREMENTS:
 For solving:
  - g++ 4.4
 For visualization:
  - Blender 2.43 with python

COMPILING:

The code is known to compile on linux using g++ 4.4.
There are no external dependencies.
Simply run 'make' in the current directory.

RUNNING:

To solve the original Hanamaya Cast Laby, run the program with:

./laby laby.ppm 52.5 240 s > output.path

This tells the program to read the geometry definition from laby.ppm,
and defines the inter-pin distance and ring size to be 52.5 and 240 respectively.
The 's' switches the top and bottom labyrinths.

The output goes into 'output.path'.
You can use pgmtoobj to create a 3D model:

./pgmtoobj laby.ppm > output.obj

And import it into blender using the 'Wavefron OBJ' importer.

To import the output paths into blender, open 'makepaths.py' into
blender and edit the filename to be 'output.path'.
